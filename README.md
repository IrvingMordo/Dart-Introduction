Welcome to **Dart Introduction**, a repository designed to learn and practice the fundamentals of the **Dart** language, from the very basics to advanced concepts such as asynchrony and streams.  

This project is aimed at:  
- Students who are starting to program in Dart.  
- Developers looking to strengthen their fundamentals.  
- People who want to build a foundation for **Flutter** projects.  

---

## Project Goals  

✔️ Provide clear and well-commented examples of the main Dart concepts.  
✔️ Serve as a quick reference guide.  
✔️ Facilitate step-by-step execution of examples.  
✔️ Prepare the groundwork for **Flutter** projects and other Dart-based environments.
